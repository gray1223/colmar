Looked great in my chrome browser, needed to zoom out in edge and so did my advisors. I had some issues with scaling and couldn't find a fix to the element 
overlap without zooming in zome form. I'd appreciate tips on how to make it fit other browsers... Despite it looking perfect on my computer and my chrome browser.
It should look OK after zooming in or out, it was perfect at 100% on chrome for me and 90% edge.

I didn't do the mobile version because of previous experience dealing with mobile webistes during this intensive;
My phone and tablet rendered the Tortoiseshell Optics website well, as well as Tea Cozy and all the others. I would like feedback on just desktop please! Please let me know 
how I should improve my desktop version and positioning so it is responsive in all browsers on PC? Thank you!

Sincerely,
Grayson Bertaina
